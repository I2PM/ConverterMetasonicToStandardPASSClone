- Mapping model elements to OWL structures
- Export as a standards-compliant OWL model
- Support for subjects, states, transitions, messages, and more

## Requirements

## Usage

string sourcePath = @"Path\to\model.jpp";
string destinationPath = @"Path\to\model.owl";
string baseuri = "http://www.example.org/myprocess";

var converter = new PASSConverterMetasonicToStandard(sourcePath);
converter.convertMetasonicModelToOWLStandard(destinationPath, baseuri);
